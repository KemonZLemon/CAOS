Homework 4 -- Gradeable is available in Submitty
-- pthread_detach() vs pthread_join()

                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+---------+
    MAIN thread: | T1 | T3 | T8 | T9 |    |    |   ...   |
                 | run| blk| ...| .. |    |    |   ...   |
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+---------+

      for Homework 4, just use pthread_detach()...

      ...when you receive a SIGUSR1 (shutdown) signal

        in your UDP code, the main/parent thread
         is blocked on recvfrom()

        e.g.,
         -- main thread running, blocked on recvfrom()
         -- child thread in encode_message()
         -- child thread in encode_message()
         -- child thread in encode_message()
         -- child thread in decode_message()

       if this process receives a SIGUSR1 signal, we need
        to shutdown the process
